In this project, we will use Keras and Tensorflow to build, train, and test a convolutional neural network capable of identifying the breed of a dog in a supplied image. This project encompasses a supervised learning problem, specifically a multiclass classification problem.

To run:
python -m streamlit run main_app.py
